TODO: Document your missing data handling:
- How many missing values did you find? : Missing value count: 323
- What percentage of data was missing? Missing value percentage: 96.4%
- Which method did you use to fill missing values? Imputation using rolling mean with a window of 3 days.
- Why did you choose that method?: Given the high percentage of missing values (96.4%), 
using a rolling mean helps to provide a more stable estimate of the missing values by considering the surrounding data points. 
This is particularly useful in time series data analysis where values are often correlated.
- What are the pros/cons of your approach? it smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends or cycles.
- Include examples showing missing data patterns:
