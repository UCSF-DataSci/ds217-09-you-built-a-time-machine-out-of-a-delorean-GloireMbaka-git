- What timezone was your original data in: UTC time: 2025-11-19 20:46:57.590330+00:00?
- How did you localize the data: I localized the date using patient_vitals_tz.index = patient_vitals_tz.index.tz_localize('UTC')?
- What timezone did you convert to: I converted the UTC into the US/Eastern ime using tz_convert('US/Eastern')  ?
- What issues did you encounter with DST? (Note: Using UTC avoids DST ambiguity)
: There were no issues encountered with DST because UTC does not observe daylight saving time,
- Include at least one example showing a datetime before and after conversion : 
patient visit (UTC): '2023-01-03 00:00:00+00:00'
Patient visit (US/Eastern): '2023-01-03 19:00:00-05:00'
- Explain why UTC is recommended as the base timezone for storing temporal data: 
Using UTC as the base timezone for storing temporal data is recommended because it provides a consistent reference point that is not affected by local time changes,
such as daylight saving time (DST) transitions. Local timezones can shift forward or backward during DST changes, 
which can lead to ambiguity and errors in time calculations. 
For example, a timestamp recorded during the fall back transition may occur twice, making it unclear which instance is being referred to. 
By storing all timestamps in UTC, we eliminate these ambiguities and ensure that time comparisons and calculations remain accurate regardless of the local timezone. 
When displaying or analyzing data, we can then convert UTC timestamps to the appropriate local timezone as needed, ensuring clarity and consistency across different regions and time periods.
